# ðŸš€ Fire Framework

A while back, I set out to create something lightweight yet powerful for building web applications. The goal? A minimalist PHP framework that doesnâ€™t get in your way but still packs a punch.

The **Fire Framework** was born out of a need for simplicity and scalability. With support for PHP 8+ and a modular architecture, itâ€™s designed to keep your code clean, maintainable, and future-ready.

But I didnâ€™t stop there. To make things even smoother, I put together the **Fire Project Starter Kit** â€” a pre-configured setup with all the essentials to get you rolling in no time.

### Why Fire?

Because sometimes, less is more. The **Fire Framework** is all about giving you the tools you need without the bloat. Whether youâ€™re building a small project or something bigger, Fire has your back.
