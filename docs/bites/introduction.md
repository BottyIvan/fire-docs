# ðŸ”® The lore about fire

A few days back at work, I kicked off a project to streamline database tasksâ€”think migrations, data transfers, and the like. What started as a lone PHP class in a random file quickly outgrew its humble beginnings. I knew I needed structure, but diving into a heavyweight framework like Laravel (the new release 12 rocks as fuck) felt like overkill. So, I went for a leaner vibe, crafting a lightweight MVC-based core framework.

Fast forward to some late-night tinkering at home, and the idea hit me: why not build something sleek, practical, and ready to roll for small projects?

And just like that, the **Fire Project** was born.
