# 🔮 The Lore About Fire

A few days back at work, I kicked off a project to handle some operations on databases — like moving between two different hosts, migrations, checking for strict mode, and yeah, you name it.
What started as a lone PHP class in some random file quickly outgrew its humble beginnings.

I knew I needed structure, but diving into a heavyweight framework like **Laravel** (and yeah, version 12 is fire 🔥) felt like overkill.

So, I went for a leaner vibe — crafted a lightweight, MVC-based core framework.

Fast forward to some late-night tinkering at home, and the idea hit me:
**Why not build something sleek, practical, and ready to roll for small projects?**

And just like that, the **Fire Project** was born.
